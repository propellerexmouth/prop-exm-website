								<h2 class="major">The Mission</h2>
								<h3>Propeller is a vibrant, inclusive community of passionate and experienced entrepreneurs, creatives, problem solvers, engineers, technologists and makers.</h3>
								<p>We share a culture of curiosity, knowledge-sharing and professionalism with a love of living by the sea. <strong>We love Exmouth</strong> and believe it is uniquely positioned to provide the ultimate work/life balance.</p>
								<hr>
								<h4>Creating impact</h4>
								<p>Our aim is to provide an exciting space for new opportunities to surface and existing ventures to thrive via collaboration, experimentation and business support. Our first location will include a mix of desk/office/meeting space, presentation space, maker space, media rooms and group spaces - NOT a bunch of desks to rent in a serviced office, but a space to succeed.</p>
								<p>By adopting a pay-it-forward attitude and embracing reciprocal business models we also encourage our community members to share their skills with local businesses, schools and groups through activities such as workshops, talks and mentor-programmes to ultimately grow our local economy and provide exciting job opportunities for future generations.</p>
								<p>You can think of our mission as cultivating an ecosystem that paves the way for world-class companies to be created - a stone’s throw from the beach.</p>

								<h2 class="major">The Space</h2>
								<p>Although this looks like a bit of a copout, we can only tell you that we have great space lined up, and currently we are in the last stages of securing funding. As a teaser - it's in a great location in the heart of Exmouth (Devon, UK), near the beach, town centre and transport links...</p>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/pic02.jpg" alt="" /></span>
								<p><em>We have spent 2 years since running a pilot project at Rolle College trying to find the right building, so just in case we are keeping this building's location under wraps.</em></p>

						<!-- Prices -->
							<article id="prices">
								<h2 class="major">Prices</h2>
								<p>Our plan has always been to keep costs as low as possible and we have done extensive research into fees from London to Cornwall. And also remember this isn't about desk space. <b>This is about being a part of a community where we help each other create, grow and scale businesses and ideas</b>.</p>
								<blockquote>
									<h3>Earlybird discount&hellip;</h3>
									<p>Right now we are offering special pricing for early residents who can commit right now for 12 months. This will help us to invest in the building - essentially crowdfunding where the reward is a lower rate!</p>
